**Security & Compliance**: Comprehensive data protection including encryption at rest and in transit, row-level security, role-based access control, and GDPR compliance with automated data retention and anonymization.

### üèóÔ∏è Core Components

1. **Data Model**: Five core tables (studies, participants, applications, completions, daily_metrics) with comprehensive indexing strategy
2. **Time-Series Optimization**: TimescaleDB hypertables, continuous aggregates, and retention policies
3. **Query Optimization**: Materialized views, stored procedures, and performance monitoring
4. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with read replicas, data sharding, and partitioning strategies

## üèóÔ∏è Database Architecture

### Primary Database: PostgreSQL 15+

**Rationale**: PostgreSQL is chosen for its ACID compliance, advanced analytics capabilities, JSON support, and excellent performance for time-series data.

#### Core Data Model

We will create the following core tables to support the research analytics dashboard:

1. **Studies Table**: Store study information including type, status, target participants, budget, and metadata
2. **Participants Table**: Store participant demographics, consent status, and regional information
3. **Study Applications Table**: Track applications with eligibility scores and application data
4. **Study Completions Table**: Record completion data, quality scores, and compensation
5. **Daily Metrics Table**: Aggregated daily metrics partitioned by date for efficient querying

#### Indexing Strategy

We will implement a comprehensive indexing strategy to ensure efficient query performance:

- **Primary indexes** on frequently queried columns (date, study_type, age_group, region)
- **Composite indexes** for common query patterns and filter combinations
- **Partial indexes** for active data to reduce index size and improve performance
- **GIN indexes** for JSONB columns to enable efficient JSON querying

### Time-Series Database: TimescaleDB Extension

**Rationale**: TimescaleDB provides native time-series capabilities, automatic partitioning, and hypertables for efficient time-based queries.

#### Time-Series Optimizations

We will leverage TimescaleDB features to optimize time-series data:

- **Hypertables** for automatic time-based partitioning of daily metrics
- **Continuous aggregates** for pre-computed hourly and daily aggregations
- **Retention policies** to automatically manage data lifecycle and storage costs
- **Time-bucket functions** for efficient time-range queries

## üóÑÔ∏è Caching Strategy

### Multi-Layer Caching Architecture

We will implement a two-tier caching strategy to optimize performance and reduce database load:

#### 1. Application-Level Cache (Redis)

**Purpose**: Cache frequently accessed aggregated data and user sessions.

**Strategy**:

- Cache summary metrics, trends data, and comparison data with appropriate TTL
- Use consistent key naming conventions for cache management
- Implement cache invalidation strategies for data updates

#### 2. Database Query Cache (PostgreSQL)

**Purpose**: Optimize database query performance through materialized views and query caching.

**Strategy**:

- Create materialized views for common aggregations and complex queries
- Implement scheduled refresh strategies for materialized views
- Use query statistics to identify and optimize slow queries

## üìä Query Optimization

### Query Performance Strategy

We will implement a comprehensive query optimization strategy:

1. **Query Pattern Analysis**: Monitor and analyze query patterns to identify optimization opportunities
2. **Optimized Queries**: Create stored procedures and functions for common query patterns
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement query performance monitoring and alerting

### Optimization Techniques

- **Materialized Views**: Pre-compute complex aggregations
- **Query Rewriting**: Optimize query plans and execution
- **Index Optimization**: Regular index maintenance and optimization
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management

## üîí Data Security & Compliance

### Data Protection Strategy

We will implement comprehensive data protection measures:

#### 1. Data Encryption

- **Encryption at Rest**: Database-level encryption for sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit**: SSL/TLS for all data transmission
- **Column-level Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive participant data

#### 2. Access Control

- **Row-level Security**: Implement RLS policies for data access control
- **Role-based Access**: Define roles for different user types and permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for data access

#### 3. Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance

- **Data Retention**: Automated data retention and deletion policies
- **Consent Management**: Track and manage participant consent

## üìà Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling Strategy

We will design the system to scale horizontally as data and user load grows:

#### 1. Database Scaling

- **Read Replicas**: Distribute read queries across multiple database instances
- **Sharding Strategy**: Implement data sharding by region, date, and study type
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent load balancing for database connections

#### 2. Data Partitioning

- **List Partitioning**: Partition studies by type for specialized queries
- **Hash Partitioning**: Distribute participants across partitions

#### 3. Performance Tuning

- **Database Configuration**: Optimize PostgreSQL configuration for high performance
- **Query Optimization**: Regular query analysis and optimization
- **Resource Management**: Efficient resource allocation and monitoring

## üîÑ Data Migration Strategy

### Zero-Downtime Migration

We will implement a zero-downtime migration strategy to ensure business continuity:

1. **Dual Write Phase**: Write data to both old and new systems
2. **Data Validation Phase**: Validate data consistency between systems
3. **Traffic Switch Phase**: Gradually switch traffic to new system
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Remove old system and clean up resources

#### Rollback Strategy

- **Automatic Rollback**: Implement automatic rollback triggers for critical issues
- **Manual Rollback**: Define manual rollback procedures for complex scenarios
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data integrity throughout migration process

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting

### Comprehensive Monitoring Strategy

We will implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for system health and performance:

#### 1. Database Monitoring
